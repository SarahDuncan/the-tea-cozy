# teacozy
'The Tea Cozy' is a project I did whilst on the codecademy.com web development course. I had just learned about the flexbox model and was given this project to do on my own without help to apply the new knowledge. I enjoyed it and did it in a few consecutive hours. 
Tea Cozy incorporated:
-HTML5
-CSS3:
 -Positioning of elements with block elements and containers & the flexbox model containers
 -Git &
 -Github
