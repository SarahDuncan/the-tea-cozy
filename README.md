# Tea Cozy
'The Tea Cozy' is a project I did whilst on the codecademy.com Web Development course. I had just learned about the flexbox model and was given this project to do on my own without guidance to apply the new knowledge. I enjoyed it and did it in a few hours. 
The Tea Cozy project incorporated HTML5, CSS3 (Positioning of elements with block elements and containers, and the flexbox model containers), Git and GitHub.
