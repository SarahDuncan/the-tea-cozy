# Tea Cozy 
'The Tea Cozy' is a project I did whilst on the [codecademy.com 'Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages'](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites) skillpath. I had just learned about the flexbox model and was given this project to do on my own without guidance. I enjoyed it!
The Tea Cozy project incorporated HTML5, CSS3 (Positioning of elements with block elements and containers, and the flexbox model containers), Git and GitHub.
It is live [here](https://sarahduncan.github.io/the-tea-cozy/).
